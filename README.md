# geocoding
Created with python code using folium and geopy Nominatim.

The geocoding.py python code creates coordinates from given addresses and place them in a map. Furthermore, it filters all addresses in order to find broken ones that do not correspond in any coordinate. Then it creates two csv files of “broken” and “matched” addresses, as well as creates a folium map with the correct coordinates placed upon it. 

The map itself offers various tools such as a marker-group filters, many Tile-Layers as well as a drawing Toolkit. Finally, it is portable, hence very useful when you need to communicate geo-data with anyone.
